## MarioFootball

We worked on this project for **6 weeks**, as a team of **5 students**.

I strongly participated in the global architecture of the project for the first few days of reflexion.

Besides the little and diverses parts of gameplay script i wrote (mainly on singletons and `Player.cs`),  
I coded :
 - the chrono class (*Chrono.cs*)
 - the cameras system (*CameraManager.cs*, *CameraController.cs*);
 - the complete functioning of the `CameraControlQueue` (*CameraManager.cs*) and the `PlayerActionsQueue` (*Player.cs*);
 - the item-related scripts (Scripts/Items).

I also organised the scripts (for instance with regions and local functions).
